The goal of this project is to replicate the Computer Science Application Process at CSUS. This application will run based off of a point system, where certain conditions are met depending on how many points a person has accumulated throughout the process. The points will be divvied out by means of a tree data structure, where different nodes will be worth different points. If the condition for a certain node is met, however many points the node is worth is then added to the running total.
